Step-by-Step Process for Cloning a Git Repository in Simulink Online

 1. Open Simulink Online
   - Visit [MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) in your browser and log in using your MathWorks account.

 2. Open a New or Existing Project
   - In Simulink Online, click on Project in the top toolbar.
   - Select New â†’ From Git to start creating a new project from a Git repository.
   
 3. Clone a Git Repository
   - A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter the URL of the Git repository.
   
   1. Enter the repository URL: This is the HTTPS or SSH URL for the Git repository you want to clone (e.g., `[https://github.com/bonic-projects/iot-enabled-bms-with-enhanced-fire-protection-and-soh-soc-sop-monitoring-with-backup-time-](https://github.com/bonic-projects/pv-integrated-ev-charger-with-v-to-l-compatability)`).
   
   2. Choose a Local Directory: The project will be cloned into the Simulink Online workspace, and you will not need to specify a local directory as it's handled automatically in the cloud.

   4. Clone the repository: Click Clone to begin cloning the repository into Simulink Online.

 4. Working with the Cloned Project
   - Once the repository is cloned, Simulink Online will open the project. You can now see all the files from the repository in the Current Folder panel.
   
   - You can start editing, running simulations, and developing Simulink models as usual.
